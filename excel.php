                        <p>For Nic Pottebaum, receiving a Hancher-Finkbine Medallion, one of Iowa’s more prestigious awards, is not only an honor but instills pride in being a student at the UI. As a recent graduate and the former UISG president for the 2012-2013 academic year, his work as a campus leader was not something easily acquired, but required hard work and real world experience.</p>
                        <p>“Somewhere along the way I became a campus leader, but I never thought of it as striving for that title,” says Pottebaum. “Rather, I saw the opportunities that made me a campus leader just an opportunity to benefit my fellow students.”</p>
                        <p>The recent Iowa graduate was one of seven on campus who earned an award for their work on campus. This annual tradition of recognizing campus leaders had earnest beginnings as simply an event to bring people together on campus. Starting in 1917, dinners sponsored by William Finkbine and Carl Kuhnle were meant to gather leaders on campus, both students and professionals, to create connections and lasting ties on campus. The dinners were proven to be so successful that Finkbine created an endowment for them to continue.</p>
                        <p>Each year a total of seven students, faculty, staff, and alumni are invited to attend the Finkbine dinner along with the UI president, deans, and other members of the UI. It is Finkbine’s hope that the leaders of the UI would come together to have a better understanding of each other and their shared concern for the livelihood of the university. Four students, one professor, one staff member, and one alumnus are given awards for their outstanding work on campus.</p>
                        <p>“Every time I just get amazed [by the students] because they do something different that I have just never heard of before,” says Belinda Marner, Assistant Vice President for Student Life and Chair of the Finkbine Dinner Committee. “It’s one of the highlights of the year for me because you just think about all the things these people are doing and where they’re going - it’s amazing to think about.”</p>
                        <p>The purpose of honoring attendees with medallions is to recognize leadership, learning, and loyalty. The tradition of awarding medallions was established in 1964. These medallions are named after William Finkbine as well as Virgil Hancher who was a guest at the first dinner and served as president of the UI for 24 years.</p>
                        <p>Pottebaum believes these positive qualities are important to honor at the university. Every student no matter who they are and how they serve on campus should attain these qualities and use them whether they be on another college campus or in another part of the world.</p>
                        <p>“My experience at Iowa taught me to balance many things while always valuing those around and doing things the right way,” says Pottebaum. “There are countless failures and successes I learned in my four years that will guide me for the rest of my life.”</p>

                        <p>Attending college is not only about excelling academically, but also using those skills outside of the classroom. For Sydney Mason, a member of Walk It Out, attending college means working with local businesses to celebrate diversity, fashion, and raise awareness for HIV/AIDS-related issues. Walk It Out (WIO) is one of several student organizations recognized at the Hawkeye Leadership & Service Awards held on May 1st at the Iowa Memorial Union.</p>
                        <p>“It’s an amazing feeling to be recognized for the hard work we do throughout the year,” says Mason, a UI senior in Anthropology and Geography.
                        The Hawkeye Leadership & Service Awards celebrated the accomplishments of student organizations, student leaders, student organization advisors, and campus partners. The Center for Student Involvement and Leadership (CSIL) works hard each year to find new ways to honor all of the unique contributions students make to both local and global causes.</p>
                        <p>"I think that there are a lot of cool things that our students are doing,” says Paul Mintner, Coordinator for Leadership Programs in CSIL. “The commitment that students have for their student organizations and the work that they do is a great developmental thing."</p>
                        <p>Although the strength of the academic programs at UI is at the core of what attracts students to the university, academics are not everything, according to Mintner. By being part of student organizations, students can implement many of the skills they learn in the classroom in a co-curricular setting that benefits the campus and the community. Membership in a student organization also allows students to explore different interests while putting academic skills to use.</p>

                    <div class="col-1-2">
                        <p>“I think it’s good to have students actively engaged in what they care about,” says Mintner. “I think that says a lot about the type of student that comes to Iowa and the students that we want to have here.”</p>
                        <p>There are many different corners of the university that students can explore through student organizations. Mason was drawn to Walk It Out in 2009 because of her interest in diversity and promoting HIV/AIDS awareness. This year, Walk It Out is one of two student organizations that won an award for their Outstanding Diversity Awareness Program.</p>
                        <p>“Along with promoting HIV/AIDS awareness, WIO also encourages students and community members of any ethnicity and orientation to become involved in our events,” says Mason. “We believe this allows for people to not only expand their horizons and learn about the various cultures in the area, but also be proud of their heritage and showcase their cultural roots in a positive environment.”
                        Walk It Out’s engagement exemplifies what the Hawkeye Leadership & Service Awards are about. According to Mintner, the efforts of these students are a reflection of what the University of Iowa strives to do for local and global communities.</p>
                        <p>“The [Hawkeye Awards] are meant to honor the undergraduate and the graduate student experience,” says Mintner. “I think that’s a special thing about it, too, is that it’s meant to honor any student who attends this institution and  [has] a strong commitment to be involved and make a contribution than just attending this university.”</p>

                        <h2>CRWC hosts second annual Midwest Outdoor Leadership Conference</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <p>The University of Iowa hosted nearly 100 students at the second annual Midwest Outdoor Leadership Conference (MWOLC) on Feb. 22-24, 2013. Every year MWOLC invites students from college outdoor recreation programs across the Midwest to meet for one weekend in order to learn skills that will benefit their future careers in the outdoor recreation industry.</p>
                        <p>According to David Patton, Assistant Director for Recreational Services and Outdoor Programs at UI, the MWOLC is modeled on the Association of Outdoor Recreation and Education (AORE) Conference.</p>
                        <p>“I go to AORE every year, but it’s mainly people like me, the full-time person that runs the outdoor program, and it’s sort of limiting to students,” Patton says, referencing AORE’s high cost, week-long timeframe, and distant location.  “It’s great for [full-time staff] to do that and stay on the edge, but we need opportunities for the students.”</p>
                        <p>Outdoor recreation professionals at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio pinpointed the growing need for a convention tailored to aspiring outdoor recreation leaders and set out to create the first-ever Midwest Outdoor Leadership Conference, which Ohio State University hosted in 2011.</p>
                        <p>“Last year, I promised that I’d bring a van full of Iowa students out to Ohio State to support the conference and we did,” Patton says. “We had so much fun. The conference organizers saw our enthusiasm and they asked us to host it this year, so we did.”</p>
                        <p>MWOLC featured breakout sessions with special emphasis on leadership development, program management, professional development, and skill development. Attendees also had the chance to relax and have fun with events like a bouldering competition, open climbing time, and a documentary viewing.</p>
                        <p>In order to keep the conference accessible to all students, the MWOLC charged a conference registration fee of $50, a relatively small payment considering that professional conferences like AORE cost hundreds of dollars. Students were able to camp on the turf of the Hawkeye Tennis and Recreation Complex (HTRC) for free. Marmot outfitters sponsored a raffle and the keynote speaker, professional mountaineer Fabrizio Zangrilli. The well-known mountaineer gave students an in-depth look at what it’s like to be a leader in outdoor recreation. Zangrilli told students about his extensive list of outdoor experiences, including key accomplishments like climbing K2 and guiding groups of people through the Himalayas.</p>
                        <p>Conference attendees enjoyed the opportunity to learn from seasoned outdoor leaders like Zangrilli, and were grateful for the ability to network with like-minded people.</p>
                        <p>“It is so easy to meet and talk to new people because we’re all here for the same thing. It’s been really helpful,” says Courtney Sullivan, junior at Bowling Greens State University.</p>
                        <p>Patton’s entire student staff at the Campus Recreation and Wellness Center participated in the conference. The students were able to waive  the registration fee in exchange for volunteering to work the conference.</p>
                        <p>Patton was proud to host the 2013 conference at UI’s facilities, but his favorite part of the three-day weekend was sharing the world of outdoor recreation with students.</p>
                        <p>“The highlight of the conference for me is seeing the younger folks. It opens their eyes a bit to how big outdoor recreation is. It’s not just students at the Iowa Rec Center working the climbing wall,” Patton says. “It’s great for my staff to see that there are other people in the world, and other universities that do the same sort of thing that we do.”</p>
                        <p>Students that attended the conference are just as pleased with the event as Patton. Andrew McQuillen, a student at the University of Dayton, shared his comments on the value of the weekend to Facebook.</p>
                        <p>“The Midwest Outdoor Leadership Conference at the University of Iowa was amazing. I heard some incredible stories and met some incredible people, all who share an awesome passion for the outdoors. I’m 100% confident in my decision to pursue outdoor education and recreation as a career.”</p>
                        <p>MWOLC Keynote Speaker Zangrilli also gave UI conference organizers positive feedback. Zangrilli published his thoughts to Facebook, saying  “I had a super fun time, met some really interesting and motivated people and got to sample some great nightlife in Iowa City as well.” The mountaineer also playfully added a note to the school who hosts next year’s conference.  “Good luck next year to the university that puts the event on – [a] tough act to follow for sure!”</p>
